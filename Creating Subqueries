# Below are two examples of creating subqueries.

## Example 1. Find the average amount paid by the top 5 customers.

SELECT AVG(total_payment_amount) AS average
FROM 
	(SELECT A.customer_id,
		A.first_name,
		A.last_name,
		D.country,
		C.city,
		SUM(amount) as "total_payment_amount"
	FROM customer A
	INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_ID = B.address_ID
	INNER JOIN city C ON B.city_ID = C.city_ID
	INNER JOIN country D on C.country_ID = D.country_ID
	INNER JOIN payment E on A.customer_ID = E.customer_ID
	WHERE city IN ('Cape Coral','Santa Brbara dOeste','Memphis','Tanza','Valparai','Santa Rosa','Aurora','Tanauan','Halisahar','Bijapur')
	GROUP BY A.customer_id, first_name, last_name, country, city
	ORDER BY SUM(amount) DESC
	LIMIT 5) AS "total_amount_paid"

## Example 2. Find out how many of the top 5 customers are based in each country.

-- OUTER STATEMENT PT. I
SELECT 
D.country,
COUNT(DISTINCT A.customer_ID) as all_customer_count,
COUNT(DISTINCT top_5_customers.customer_ID) as top_customer_count
FROM customer A
	INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_ID = B.address_ID
	INNER JOIN city C ON B.city_ID = C.city_ID
	INNER JOIN country D on C.country_ID = D.country_ID
-- INNER QUERY
LEFT JOIN 
	(SELECT A.customer_id,
		A.first_name,
		A.last_name,
		D.country,
		C.city,
		SUM(amount) as total_payment_amount
	FROM customer A
	INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_ID = B.address_ID
	INNER JOIN city C ON B.city_ID = C.city_ID
	INNER JOIN country D on C.country_ID = D.country_ID
	INNER JOIN payment E on A.customer_ID = E.customer_ID
	WHERE city IN ('Cape Coral','Santa Brbara dOeste','Memphis','Tanza','Valparai','Santa Rosa','Aurora','Tanauan','Halisahar','Bijapur')
	GROUP BY A.customer_id, first_name, last_name, country, city
	ORDER BY total_payment_amount DESC
	LIMIT 5) AS "top_5_customers"
	ON D.country = top_5_customers.country
-- OUTER STATEMENT PT. II
GROUP BY D.country
ORDER BY top_customer_count DESC
LIMIT 5
