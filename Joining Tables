Example 1. Write a query to find the top 10 countries for Rockbuster in terms of customer numbers. 
Description: For this first query, I joined the customer, address, city, and country tables in order to get a 
count of how many customers are located in each country. This shows us the count of customers for each country 
from highest to lowest.  

SELECT D.country,
	COUNT(customer_ID)
FROM customer A
INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_ID = B.address_ID
INNER JOIN city C ON B.city_ID = C.city_ID
INNER JOIN country D on C.country_ID = D.country_ID
GROUP BY country
ORDER BY COUNT(customer_ID) DESC
LIMIT 10

Example 2. Write a query to find the top 10 cities within the top 10 countries identified in Example 1. 
Description: Initially, I wrote a query using WHERE to see which cities had the highest number of customers in 
the countries with the highest number of customers. However, I quickly noticed that there was only one city listed 
that had a count of customers >1. 

I then took a step back to see how many customers were in each city (keeping in mind that there are 599 customers 
listed in the customer table). From the second query (shown above), I could see that there were only two cities that 
had >1 customers – London, United Kingdom and Aurora, United States. Because the other 597 cities would be tied for 
second with a count of 1, I decided that there needed to be a different metric to determine the “top cities in the top country.”

For the last query, I added the payment table in order to get a sum of the “amount” field (note, I rewrote the query to change 
the sum field to be called “sum_payment” but didn’t re-take the screenshots!). With this query, I can see the top 10 cities 
for the top 10 countries by how many dollars brought in through payments. I could also limit this query to 10 to show the top 
ten (1-10), but above, I’ve highlighted the top city for each top country.


Step 1.
SELECT D.country,
	C.city,
	COUNT(customer_ID)
FROM customer A
INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_ID = B.address_ID
INNER JOIN city C ON B.city_ID = C.city_ID
INNER JOIN country D on C.country_ID = D.country_ID
WHERE country IN ('India','China','United States','Japan','Mexico','Brazil','Russian Federation','Philippines','Turkey','Indonesia')
GROUP BY country, city
ORDER BY COUNT(customer_ID) DESC
LIMIT 10

Step 2.
SELECT D.country,
	C.city,
	COUNT(customer_ID)
FROM customer A
INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_ID = B.address_ID
INNER JOIN city C ON B.city_ID = C.city_ID
INNER JOIN country D on C.country_ID = D.country_ID
GROUP BY country,city
ORDER BY COUNT(customer_ID) DESC

Step 3. 
SELECT D.country,
	C.city,
	SUM(amount) AS “sum_payment”
FROM customer A
INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_ID = B.address_ID
INNER JOIN city C ON B.city_ID = C.city_ID
INNER JOIN country D on C.country_ID = D.country_ID
INNER JOIN payment E on A.customer_ID = E.customer_ID
WHERE country IN ('India','China','United States','Japan','Mexico','Brazil','Russian Federation','Philippines','Turkey','Indonesia')
GROUP BY country, city
ORDER BY SUM(amount) DESC

Example 3. Write a query to find the top 5 customers in the top 10 cities who have paid the highest total amounts to Rockbuster. 
Description: The first query below (Option 1) shows the top five customers when using the WHERE for one city per each top country 
(i.e. the cities found in Example 2 Step 3). The second query below (Option 2) shows the top five customers when using the WHERE for 
the top 10 cities based on amount paid (duplicate coutries allowed). 

If Rockbuster is interested in selecting customers who have had the most amount paid regardless if there are customers who come 
from the same country, I would suggest referring to Option 2 below.

If Rockbuster is interested in only selecting one customer in each country (most amount paid), I would suggest referring to Option 1 below. 

Option 1.
SELECT A.customer_id,
	A.first_name,
	A.last_name,
	D.country,
	C.city,
	SUM(amount) as "total_payment_amount"
FROM customer A
INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_ID = B.address_ID
INNER JOIN city C ON B.city_ID = C.city_ID
INNER JOIN country D on C.country_ID = D.country_ID
INNER JOIN payment E on A.customer_ID = E.customer_ID
WHERE city IN ('Cape Coral','Santa Brbara dOeste','Tanza','Valparai','Usolje-Sibirskoje','Probolinggo','Zhoushan','Balikesir','Uruapan','Shimonoseki')
GROUP BY A.customer_id, first_name, last_name, country, city
ORDER BY SUM(amount) DESC
LIMIT 5

Option 2.
SELECT A.customer_id,
	A.first_name,
	A.last_name,
	D.country,
	C.city,
	SUM(amount) as "total_payment_amount"
FROM customer A
INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_ID = B.address_ID
INNER JOIN city C ON B.city_ID = C.city_ID
INNER JOIN country D on C.country_ID = D.country_ID
INNER JOIN payment E on A.customer_ID = E.customer_ID
WHERE city IN ('Cape Coral','Santa Brbara dOeste','Memphis','Tanza','Valparai','Santa Rosa','Aurora','Tanauan','Halisahar','Bijapur')
GROUP BY A.customer_id, first_name, last_name, country, city
ORDER BY SUM(amount) DESC
LIMIT 5
