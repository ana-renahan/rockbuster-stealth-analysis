Below are two examples of creating common table expressions.

Example 1. Find the average amount paid by the top 5 customers.

WITH average_paid (customer_id, first_name, last_name, country, city, total_payment_amount) AS
	(SELECT A.customer_id,
		A.first_name,
		A.last_name,
		D.country,
		C.city,
		SUM(amount) as "total_payment_amount"
	FROM customer A
	INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_ID = B.address_ID
	INNER JOIN city C ON B.city_ID = C.city_ID
	INNER JOIN country D on C.country_ID = D.country_ID
	INNER JOIN payment E on A.customer_ID = E.customer_ID
	WHERE city IN ('Cape Coral','Santa Brbara dOeste','Memphis','Tanza','Valparai','Santa Rosa','Aurora','Tanauan','Halisahar','Bijapur')
	GROUP BY A.customer_id, first_name, last_name, country, city
	ORDER BY SUM(amount) DESC
	LIMIT 5)
SELECT AVG(total_payment_amount)
FROM average_paid

Example 2. Find out how many of the top 5 customers are based in each country. 

-- DEFINE CTE I
WITH country_customer_count (customer_id, country) AS
	(SELECT A.customer_id,
			D.country
	FROM customer A
	INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_ID = B.address_ID
	INNER JOIN city C ON B.city_ID = C.city_ID
	INNER JOIN country D on C.country_ID = D.country_ID
	INNER JOIN payment E on A.customer_ID = E.customer_ID),
--DEFINE CTE II
top_customers (top_customer_id, first_name, last_name, country, city, total_payment_amount) AS
	(SELECT A.customer_id,
		A.first_name,
		A.last_name,
		D.country,
		C.city,
		SUM(amount) as total_payment_amount
	FROM customer A
	INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_ID = B.address_ID
	INNER JOIN city C ON B.city_ID = C.city_ID
	INNER JOIN country D on C.country_ID = D.country_ID
	INNER JOIN payment E on A.customer_ID = E.customer_ID
	WHERE city IN ('Cape Coral','Santa Brbara dOeste','Memphis','Tanza','Valparai','Santa Rosa','Aurora','Tanauan','Halisahar','Bijapur')
	GROUP BY A.customer_id, first_name, last_name, country, city
	ORDER BY total_payment_amount DESC
	LIMIT 5)
-- MAIN STATEMENT
SELECT A.country,
	COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) as all_customer_count,
	COUNT(DISTINCT top_customer_id) as top_customer_count
FROM country_customer_count A
FULL JOIN top_customers B ON A.country = B.country
GROUP BY A.country
ORDER BY top_customer_count DESC
LIMIT 5
